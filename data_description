This file contains a description of the data used in this project. Data is stored and maintained by CBS.


"geolocation_data.csv" contains the GPS measurements collected in the 2022/2023 field test of the travel app.
It contains 15,654,868 rows and the following 21 columns:
- user_id: unique respondent ID
- lon: longitude measurement
- lat: latitude measurement
- day (IDate)
- timestamp (POSIXct)
- hour_unique
- obs_id
- sensor_type
- provider
- battery_level
- altitude
- bearing
- accuracy: accuracy of lon/lat measurement in meters (smaller = more precise measurement)
- med.lon: median-smoothed longitude
- med.lat: median-smoothed latitude
- lon_smoothed: true is original longitude value is not equal to the smoothed longitude value
- lat_smoothed true is original latitude value is not equal to the smoothed longitude value
- lonlat_smoothed: either lon_smoothed or lat_smoothed is true
- timediff_left: time difference (seconds) between current observations and previous observation
- timediff_right: time difference (seconds) between currect observatiosn and next observation
- quality_indicator: has been used previously to filter data based ondata quality. Data only contains 'high'


"event_data.csv" contains the event-level information based on the stop/track segmentation algorithm in the app.
It contains 14,026 rows and the following 10 columns:
- user_id
- start_time (POSIXct)
- end_time (POXIXct)
- label: either 'stop', 'track' or '' (if missing)
- label_track: transport mode label
- label_stop: stop purpuse label
- fase: one of 3 data collection phases
- VariantCode: number indicating experimental condition (not applicable for this study)
- invitedstudyduration: either 1 or 7 days
- n_geolocations: number of GPS measurements in the event


"external_validation_data_labeled.csv" contains the GPS measurements from the 2024 travel app field test.
It contains 420,007 rows and 6 columns.
This dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/essnet-ssi/geoservice-ssi as 'ssi_open_geodata.csv'


"external_validation_data_detailed.csv" contains a more detailed version of the previous data, including the accuracy and altitude variables used in this study.
It contains 420,007 rows and 29 columns.


"external_validation_events.csv" contains event-level information based on diaries kept by the respondents
It contains 134 rows and the following 4 columns:
- start_timestamp,
- end_timestamp,
- mode
- user_id
